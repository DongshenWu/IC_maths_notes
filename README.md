# Imperial College Mathematics Notes

These are the notes I am taking when studying at Imperial College, London for a mathematics degree. This project is inspired by Dexter Chua's Cambridge notes, which I am grateful to have come across in my last year of high school. You can view his notes [here](https://github.com/dalcde/cam-notes). 

All notes need to be complied with header.tex. Please feel free to correct any mistakes you see!

> **Disclaimer:** These notes are only took for the purpose of improving personal understanding. They are usually modified significantly after lectures, and do not reflect what was taught accurately. They are not endorsed by Imperial College London, in particular, any errors are almost surely mine.

All notes are still in the process of writing. The following are the courses I am taking notes for. 

## Year 1

- Introduction to University Mathematics
- Analysis I
- Linear Algebra and Groups
- Calculus and Application
- Probability and Statistics
- Introduction to Computation
- Introduction to Applied Mathematics

Here is a preview of the style of these notes. I am also trying to learn *Makefile*.
